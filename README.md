# OLS_2SLS_IV_suite
This project was an econometric exercise. I built from scratch (more or less) a regression class capable of OLS and 2SLS IV with clustered standard errors and first stage f-tests. The foundations of the class are numpy and my own knowledge of econometrics and linear algebra, with some help from sklearn for calculations using an f-distrubtion for the F-test. Application to replication of paper (Kreuger 1999). The class is found in anich_tools.py.
